This is the github repository for the "statistics and machine learning for life science" at the [SIB](https://www.sib.swiss).

This course was designed to guide participants in the exploration of the concepts of statistical modelling, 
and at the same time relate and contrast them with machine learning approaches when it comes to both classification and regression.

## pre-requisites

The course is targeted to life scientists who are already familiar with the Python programming language and who have basic knowledge on statistics.

## course organization 

The course is organized in several, numbered, jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a chapter which interleaves theory, code demo, and exercises.

The course does not require any particular expertise with jupyter notebooks to be followed, but if it is the first time you encounter them we recommend this [gentle introduction](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/).
